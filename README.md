# 0w-experimental-arduino-core
Automatically exported from code.google.com/p/0w-experimental-arduino-core

Old project from 2010: When compiled the Arduino core (0019) with avr-gcc using CodeBlocks as an IDE, I detected a bunch of warnings. So this was a version with corrections to avoid those warnings. Just that.

This wasn't a new project, but a modified Arduino core from http://arduino.cc. So the license is the same as the Arduino core. The minor modifications made here are on the public domain.
