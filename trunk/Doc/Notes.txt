::0w-experimental-arduino-core::

- The idea:
	- Experimental Arduino core to be compiled without warnings.
	- And test some new features:
		- Added new, delete, new[] and delete[] operators.
		- Added support for virtual destructors.


- Specs:
	- Current 0w-experimental-arduino-core version: v0.1
	- Current Arduino core version: 0019
	- Current compiler: WinAVR-20090313
	- Build options: See /Doc/Images/BuildOptions_NonPedantic.jpg
	- Current CPU target: ATMega328 @16 MHz


- Output:
	- When you compile this, you get a hex file that currently does nothing, and
	in addition, is too heavy (due to the compilation process). So, the idea with  
	this CodeBlocks project is just to be a test bed to eliminate the warnings, not 
	to compile a working hex. However, you can edit the main.pde file, and paste 
	any	Arduino example, and play and experiment with standard Arduino code in a
	CodeBlocks project.
